       this  code is all my configuration files - bashrc, vimrc, &c. the
       kind of stuff i don’t like rewriting  every time i go  to  a  new
       system.  the  makefile is really  superfulous in this case - it’s
       function can be  repliacted  by simplying  checking out the ’src’
       directory.  the ’dist’ target  generates  a zipfile of this whole
       directory in the directory above it.
